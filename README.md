# Getting Captain working with pytest

Starting from a [simple workflow that runs pytest][workflow-before-captain], we want to

## 1. üß™ Ensure pytest produces its reportlog output

The native pytest JUnit XML is insufficient for Captain's functionality. In place of it, we recommend installing [pytest-reportlog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog). Once installed, ensure pytest produces compatible output with:

```sh
pytest --report-log=tmp/log.json
```

## 2. üîê Create an Access Token

Create an Access Token for your organization within [Captain][captain] ([more documentation here][create-access-token]).

Add the new token as an action secret to your repository. Conventionally, we call this secret `RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## 3. üíå Install the Captain CLI and call it when running tests

See the [full documentation on test suite integration][test-suite-integration].


```yaml
- uses: rwx-research/setup-captain@v1
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    captain run \
      --suite-id captian-examples-pytest \
      --test-results tmp/log.json \
      -- pytest --report-log=tmp/log.json
  env:
    RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RWX_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

## 4. üéâ See your test results in Captain!
